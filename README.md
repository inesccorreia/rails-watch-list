# Watch List app

This project was creating during an intensive Web Developement bootcamp (full-time) at Le Wagon Lisbon, Portugal.

It's a 3-model app, a many to many relationship (N:N).

This app would allow you to create lists in which you could save your favourite movies.

It was build on Ruby on Rails with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
