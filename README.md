# Watch List app

This project was creating during an intensive Web Developement bootcamp (full-time) at Le Wagon Lisbon, Portugal.

It's a 3-model app, a many to many relationship (N:N).

This app would allow you to create lists in which you could save your favourite movies.

It was build with Ruby on Rails, postgresql database, HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap. This app would not allow users to create movies so we had to generate a static seed of movies to choose from.
